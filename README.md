# Bhuket

It makes new S3 buckets with all the proper perms. It is more than that though! It is a soon-to-be-failed attempt to learn some python.

Uses flask and boto, which both seem cool.

## Local Setup

### Init

Install python and pip and virtualenv and ruby and node and npm and all that good stuff. Then run `make init`.

### Run

`make run` - runs the app plus compass and coffeescript change watcher dudes.

Would be nice to have an asset pipeline built into the app, I bet that can be done.

## Usage

## Deployment

## TODO:

- force SSL in production (production settings in general)
- hook up Heroku
- tests
- asset situation is a mess
